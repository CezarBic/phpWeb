# phpWeb


This is my first projet created hard-code after 240 hours with a specialist developer.

Follow the steps to create database and to get full access to the functionality of the project:
* configurate your connection in the /cont/conn.php file
* create database and create this tables:

- Table `users` with rows of: `id`to be`int`, and `autoincrement`. than 
all the others rows to be type `string`
 `nameUser`, `usernameUser`, `emailUser`, `pwdUser`.
- Table `reservation` with rows of: `id`to be `int`, and `autoincrement`.
`firstname`, `lastname`, `op` to be `smallint`, `message` and the last one 
is `date` type `date` all the other rows except the one mentioned types,
to be type `string` .

With all this being said you can now enjoy my project `:)`.
